The **AstraDEX Token (ASTRA)** is the native utility token that powers the entire AstraDEX ecosystem.  
It serves as the foundation for governance, liquidity incentives, AI access, and user rewards, ensuring the platform remains decentralized, self-sustaining, and community-driven.

## Token Overview

The ASTRA token lies at the core of every feature within AstraDEX â€” from executing trades and accessing AI insights to participating in governance decisions.

## Token Utility

ASTRA is designed to provide both **functional utility** and **economic incentives** across the platform.

### 1. Governance
Token holders can participate in community voting to influence protocol updates, trading fee structures, and feature priorities.

### 2. AI Access
Users can use ASTRA tokens to unlock premium AI capabilities, such as:
- Advanced market predictions.
- Deeper technical analysis.
- Personalized trading insights.

### 3. Trading Fees
ASTRA can be used to pay trading fees with discounts when compared to payments made in other tokens.

### 4. Staking and Rewards
Users can stake ASTRA tokens to:
- Earn passive rewards from trading fees.
- Boost their AI interaction limits or analysis depth.
- Gain early access to new features or beta products.

### 5. Liquidity Incentives
Liquidity providers who contribute to AstraDEX pools are rewarded with ASTRA tokens proportional to their contribution and duration of liquidity provision.

## Token Distribution

| Category | Allocation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Community & Rewards** | 35% | Distributed to users through trading, staking, and liquidity rewards. |
| **Team & Advisors** | 20% | Allocated to core contributors and advisors, with vesting periods. |

**Vesting Schedule:**

- Ecosystem and treasury tokens: released gradually over 36 months.

## Value Mechanisms
AstraDEX introduces a **deflationary and utility-driven model** designed to support long-term token value.

### 1. Token Burn
A percentage of trading fees paid in ASTRA will be automatically burned to reduce total supply over time.

### 2. Dynamic Fee Adjustment
Users who hold or stake ASTRA receive fee reductions, encouraging long-term holding.

### 3. AI Usage Demand
As the AI Chat Agent and advanced analytics gain adoption, demand for ASTRA will naturally increase due to AI access pricing models.

### 4. Ecosystem Growth
Partnerships and third-party integrations using AstraDEX APIs will generate ASTRA transaction demand, further strengthening utility.

## Economic Vision
The economic structure of ASTRA is built for **sustainability and fairness**.  
It balances community rewards, developer incentives, and long-term ecosystem growth.  
The combination of **AI-driven functionality** and **DeFi token utility** makes ASTRA not only a trading token but also a bridge between intelligence and decentralized finance.
