Security and transparency are the foundation of the AstraDEX ecosystem.\
As a decentralized trading platform built on the **Aster Protocol**, AstraDEX prioritizes user protection, privacy, and data integrity at every level of its architecture.\
The system is designed to eliminate single points of failure and maintain full transparency for all on-chain operations.

## Infrastructure Security

AstraDEX operates on top of **Aster Protocol** and leverages the **AsterDEX API** to execute trades and retrieve market data securely.\
All requests between AstraDEX and AsterDEX are **signed and encrypted**, ensuring that data cannot be tampered with during transmission.

**Core Principles:**

- All API interactions use **HTTPS** with strict certificate validation.
- **HMAC-based signature verification** ensures authenticity and integrity.
- Each trading request is validated by the **AsterDEX smart contract layer**, preventing unauthorized or forged orders.
- Market data and user activity logs are timestamped and verifiable.

## Wallet & User Protection

AstraDEX is a **non-custodial** platform — users retain full control of their funds at all times.\
This means AstraDEX never holds private keys or assets on behalf of users.

**Security Features:**

- **Private key isolation:** All transactions are signed locally by the user’s wallet.
- **Session encryption:** Telegram Mini App sessions are securely linked to verified wallet addresses.
- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA):** Optional layer for critical operations like API key binding or large-volume trades.
- **Smart contract audits:** All trading contracts undergo independent security reviews before deployment.

## AI System Safety

Since AstraDEX integrates an **AI Chat Agent**, special measures are taken to ensure that the AI remains safe, reliable, and transparent in its responses.

**Key Safeguards:**

- **Read-only AI access:** The AI Chat Agent cannot execute trades without explicit user permission.
- **Rate limiting and prompt filtering:** Prevents spam, abuse, or malicious injection attacks.
- **AI reasoning isolation:** LangChain operates in a sandbox environment that cannot access user private data directly.
- **Continuous monitoring:** Logs and queries are anonymized for audit and improvement purposes.

## Transparency and Auditability

AstraDEX is committed to **open transparency** across all major components of the platform.\
All on-chain activities are publicly verifiable, and off-chain services maintain open audit trails.

**Transparency Mechanisms:**

- **Open-source smart contracts** for trading and settlement.
- **Public API documentation** for developers to verify data consistency.
- **Real-time analytics dashboards** for system health and uptime status.
- **AI decision logging** to explain how recommendations or analyses are generated.

## Data Privacy

User privacy is treated with the same level of importance as system security.\
AstraDEX complies with international data protection standards and never stores unnecessary user information.

**Privacy Commitments:**

- **No personal data storage:** Only wallet addresses and session tokens are maintained.
- **End-to-end encryption** for all communication between the AI, API, and Telegram Mini App.
- **Data minimization:** Only essential information required for functionality is processed.
- **Anonymous analytics:** Usage data is aggregated to improve AI accuracy without identifying users.
