## What is AsterDEX

AsterDEX is a next-generation Decentralized Exchange (DEX) built on top of the Aster Protocol, designed to make trading more accessible, intelligent, and seamless.

Unlike traditional DeFi platforms that require complex interfaces or seperate applications, AsterDEX can be accessed through **Telegram Mini App**, bringing decentralized trading closer to users everywhere.
